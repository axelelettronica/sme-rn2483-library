# SmartEverything Lion - loRa IoT transmission
----

This is a library for the Microchip RN2483 loRaWAN component.

Microchip’s RN2483 Low-Power Long Range LoRa Technology Transceiver module
provides an easy to use, low-power solution for long range wireless data transmission. 
The advanced command interface offers rapid time to market.
The RN2483 module complies with the LoRaWAN Class A protocol specifications. 
It integrates RF, a baseband controller, command Application Programming Interface (API) processor, 
making it a complete long range Solution.

The RN2483 module is suitable for simple long range sensor applications with external host MCU.
